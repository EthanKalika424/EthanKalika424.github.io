            </h3>
            <p><strong>
                Psycho Bunny is a clothing store. I was created by two guys that ued to work for Polo, but Polo did not like there styles of clothing so they
                decided to create there own clothing company. The creation of the logo was becaue one guy liked pirates and the other liked bunny, so they combined them together.

              <ul>
                <li>Contrast: The main colors the site uses are white with verity of images of the clothing they are selling. The contrast is good helping show
                    of the clothing.
                </li>
                <li>Repetition: The font, colors, and size of text and pictures is consistent throught the webpage.</li>
                <li>Alignment: The alignment of differnt tabs, text, and images all match. The website is all alligned and fancy</li>
                <li>Proximity: Things on the page are spaced out enough so that it does not feel cramped.</li>
