                My Intrest in Cars
            </h3>
            <p>
                I got Intrested into cars when I saw the first Fast and Furious movie in middle school. 
                Since then all wanted to do was to was to collect cars and feel like I was in the movies.
                My Intrest in cars only grew the older I got and more money I had had collected.

                I always have been very intrested with the Jaguar cars. Lots of Jaguar sports cars looked and moved very nicely.
                This Jaguar F-Type 2020 is pretty fast and very smooth. This car was redesigned after the Jaguar F-Type 2013 car,
                making the car look and feel lot better then its previouse model.

            <h3>
                Antique Cars
            </h3>
            <p>
                Antique cars are very special because they could have damages, missing parts or could be all new parts making the car
                loose its price. There are two diffrences between antique, classic and vintage cars. The two diffrences is the age 
                of the car and the price of the car.
            </p>
            <h4>Age of the car</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Vintage Car: Manufactured between 1919 and 1930. Either a “survivor” or restored in 
                    conformance to the original manufacturer specifications</li>
                <li>Antique Car: Manufactured 1975 or earlier (>45 years old). 
                    Either a “survivor” or restored in conformance to the original manufacturer specifications</li>
                <li>Classic Car: Manufactured 2000 or earlier (>20 years old)</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                There is no criterion for determining a vintage vs. an antique car by price, But it could indicate how valuable and
                desiable the car can be.A collector car's sale price is determined by the make and 
                model's rarity, desirability/demand by consumers, its condition, quality of restoration, and mileage.
