              <p>
                My name is Abigail Kalika and I am a freshman in highschool. 
                I am very hardworking and passionate while I also study hard to accomplish my goals.
                Taking care of my dogs at home gave me experience to take care of all types of dogs.
                I have a Shih Tzu that likes to sleep all day and play when he wakes up.
                My second dog that I have is a AirDale, he is very large weighs over 100 pounds but actls like he is still a pup.
                My third dog is a mix between a border collie and a hungarian mut, he is very fast and crazy.  
              </p>

          <h3><strong>Why allow Abigail take care of your dogs:</strong></h3>
          <div>
              <p>
                You should let me sit your dogs and walk them because I'm very responsible and experienced. 
                Furthermore, I have dog walked before with no problem ever. 
                While I am also very good with dogs I have three of my own so I am very experienced with commands and how things work.
